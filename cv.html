    <p>I'm a software developer with expertise in Clojure web application development.</p>
    <p>In my current and previous roles I have single-handedly delivered multiple projects where I was responsible for all aspects of the application development lifecycle - from requirements gathering and scope analysis; to the delivery of features through multiple rounds of feedback and QA; and finally operational support. I have also participated in the design, development, and operations of enterprise-wide, mission-critical projects as part of a team.</p>
    <p>To summarize, <strong>I'm a developer that knows how to wear many hats, and has a proven track record of writing high-quality, clean, maintainable code.</strong></p>
